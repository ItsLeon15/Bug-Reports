## What is BugReport?

Bug Report is a tool that helps server owners manage any bugs found by players which can then be accessed by a GUI. This
is especially helpful as information about the player is stored as soon as they submit a bug report. Information
collected when a bug report is submitted is as follows:

- Server Name
- Player Name
- Player's UUID
- Current World Name
- Full Message
- Category ID (If the option is turned on)
- Status (Can be customized using a GUI)
- Date & Time
- Player's Location
- Player's Game Mode

You can archive/unarchive/delete bug reports, customize the "Bug Report Details" GUI, customize all of the statuses,
language selector and more!

## Metrics Collection

Bug Report uses bStats to collect anonymous statistics about servers. If you would like to disable metrics collection,
you can do so by editing the ``plugins/bStats/config.yml`` file.
